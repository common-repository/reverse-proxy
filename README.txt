**How Reverse Proxy will work for your WordPress site?**
A Reverse Proxy takes a client's request, forwards it to one of many other servers, and then delivers the results of the server that handled the request to the client as if the proxy server had handled it. The client only talks to the Reverse Proxy and does not know that another server processed its request.

== FEATURES  ==

**Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting specifies the interval between each request from each IP address and the number of requests received within a specified time. Rate limiting is used to protect the server from DoS attacks, DDoS attacks, or prevent Slowloris attacks.  <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/setup-rate-limiting" target="_blank">Setup Guide</a>

**CORS:** The CORS feature is used to allow access to specific domains submitted by a user to make asynchronous requests to the server address. AJAX Requests to this site from another (containing an Origin header) are allowed for each domain in your multisite setup.  <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/setup-cors" target="_blank">Setup Guide</a>

**IP restriction/ Location restriction/Device-based restriction/ Country restriction:** IP restrictions allow you to limit inbound connections from a limited IP address, and to minimize unwanted traffic. IP restriction can be used to activate network security control, limiting inbound connections to web services based on IP address, location, and device, and reducing unwanted traffic. The plugin can be useful to detect Real visitors' IP Addresses. Location restriction allows you to block unauthorized access from specific geopolitical locations or regions to prevent access to web services and secure data. With device restrictions, only authorized devices will be allowed to access the organizationâ€™s data to prevent leaks and secure it from unauthorized access. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/setup-ip-restriction" target="_blank">Setup Guide for IP Restriction</a>

**NFT Token Gating:** You can set up NFT Token Gating to provide exclusive access to just a few, select users to otherwise restricted content by granting access based on the NFT ID. This is useful if you want to restrict access to your files and folders for select users, your eCommerce site dashboard, and even for gaming communities.<a href="https://www.miniorange.com/web3/nft-based-gated-content/">NFT Token gating</a>

**Load Balancing:** Load balancing guarantees that no server is overloaded by distributing network traffic among numerous servers. Load balancing allows network traffic to be distributed among multiple servers. When load balancing is enabled, it provides additional features, including application security. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/setup-load-balancing" target="_blank">Setup Guide for Load Balancing</a>

**Traffic Monitoring and Analytics:** Monitor the network's incoming and outgoing traffic to gather information on network traffic, speed, and classifications and generate an analysis report for traffic management. Traffic monitoring feature can help to check server health status. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/traffic-monitoring-analytics" target="_blank">Check Website Traffic</a>

**URL Rewriting:** URL rewriting involves changing the structure of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) when a page is loaded to make it easier to type and more readable. URL rewriting is beneficial because it makes your URL more readable, improves security, and is SEO friendly. <a href="https://blog.miniorange.com/boost-wordpress-site-performance-with-url-rewriting" target="_blank">URL Rewriting</a>

**SSL/TLS Offloading:** Enable SSL/TLS offloading in your hosting environment. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/ssl-encryption" target="_blank">SSL/TLS Encryption</a>

**Two-Factor Authentication:** Sets up two-factor authentication (2FA) for WordPress. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/mfa-for-saas-applications-using-casb" target="_blank">2FA on SaaS Apps</a>

**User Authentication:** User access requests are authenticated with a reverse proxy for user login and file restriction (SAML, OAuth, LDAP, Radius).

**Access Control:** You can only regulate priority access for authorized users or grant limited access to non-compliant guest users.
 
**Caching and Data Compression:** Cache the last copy of the resource when a client requests it, to send it the next time the user requests it. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/caching-for-secure-network" target="_blank">Content Caching for site performance</a>
 
**Bot Traffic Prevention:** Block Bad Bots and Stop Bad Bots Crawlers, Spiders, and Anti Spam Protection. <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/reverse-proxy/caching-for-secure-network" target="_blank">Block traffic bots</a>

 **Media and Content Restriction:** Control user access to content based on WordPress user role and access level. You can also set additional use restrictions such as IP, device-based, location, and country restrictions.

**Enable Limit Login Attempts:** Limit the number of retries when logging in (per IP). This is fully customizable. Adds another captcha verification. Useful for slowing down brute force attacks. The plugin redirects to the home page when an abnormal request is received. Informs the user about the remaining retries or lock time on the login page.

**Header-Based Authentication:** Set Header-based authentication which allows the users who use an on-premise application to log in through a reverse proxy. Enable header-based authentication to log in to applications using the contents of the URL header. Header-based authentication is a method by which users are authenticated to access back-end applications based on the user information sent through the HTTP headers. In the URL, the HTTP header section contains authentication parameters that can be configured to specify header-based authentication for on-premise applications.

==Benefits of Reverse proxy==
**Resource sharing between websites**: The CORS feature in Reverse Proxy is a method that allows HTTP requests, while the Same Origin Policy (or SOP) shares resources between different websites but prevents reading HTTP response information.

**Modern Browser Support**: The CORS function in the reverse proxy is supported by almost all modern browsers, unlike JSONP.

**Support for Legacy Applications**: Header-based authentication allows users to log in to existing on-premises applications using the contents of the HTTP URL header. Header Based Authentication provides easy SSO login to legacy applications using a reverse proxy.

**Prevention of Resource Starvation**: The most typical purpose of rate limiting is to limit the API rate to minimize resource starvation, which improves the availability of API-based applications.

**Controlling flow**: You can use Rate Limiting to control data and message flows in complicated, networked systems that handle large volumes of data and messages, whether you're aggregating many data streams into a single service or distributing a single workstream to a large number of workers. Rate Limiting's solution is scalable and can be easily deployed.

**Keeping expenses down**: Reverse Proxy can be used by an organization to prevent research from getting out of hand and incurring huge expenses when searching for the best security solutions such as IP Restriction, Location Restriction, Country Restriction, Device Restriction, Header Based Authentication, Media Restriction, 2FA, MFA, URL rewriting, file restriction, rate limiting, caching load balancing, bot traffic prevention, authentication (SAML, OAuth, LDAP, Radius), SSL offloading, TLS offloading, access control, traffic monitoring, and analysis, and more.

**Improved WordPress Site Performance**: Reverse Proxy reduces the additional load on a server and ensures smooth operation and responses. With solutions such as load balancing to shift the data load to the web servers and with traffic monitoring and analytics to check incoming traffic and user actions, a better experience is created for customers.

**Reduced Downtime**: Failed and underperforming components can be replaced immediately with no or minimal downtime while providing information on which devices need maintenance. This can be monitored with the traffic monitoring and analysis solution to monitor incoming traffic and verify each user action performed.

**Protection**: Reverse Proxy adds an extra layer of security to your website and applications without requiring any changes, with advanced security solutions such as IP restriction, location restriction, device restriction, country restriction, header-based authentication, media restriction, authentication (SAML, OAuth, LDAP, Radius), 2FA, MFA, URL rewriting, file restriction, rate limiting, caching, load balancing, bot traffic prevention, SSL offloading, TLS offloading, access control, traffic monitoring and analysis, and more.

**Scalability**: Reverse Proxy, allows you to deploy additional servers to improve performance when a server is under heavy load, using solutions such as load balancing to support high traffic loads. With Traffic Monitoring and Analytics, you can monitor the traffic and user actions of each user.

**Protection**: Reverse proxy can be used to restrict IP addresses from a specific range to improve security using IP restriction. IP restriction prevents unauthorized access to your applications based on IP addresses. File restriction prevents unwanted access to WP files and folders.

**Increased flexibility**: The number of IP addresses you can use is unlimited. You can also set access control restrictions such as IP restriction, location restriction, device restriction, country restriction, file restriction, and more.

**Manage Site and Network Traffic**: Reverse Proxy can help to manage and minimize unwanted traffic. With Traffic Monitoring and Analytics users can monitor the traffic and user actions performed on their website.

**Accuracy**: All Reverse Proxy features are synchronized so that the authorization is highly accurate and Security is enhanced with advanced security solutions like IP Restriction, Location Restriction, Device Restriction, Country Restriction, Header Based Authentication, Media Restriction, Authentication(SAML, OAuth, LDAP, Radius),  2FA, MFA, URL Rewriting, Rate Limiting, Caching, Load Balancing, Bot traffic Prevention, SSL offloading, TLS offloading, Access Control, File Restriction, Traffic Monitoring and Analytics, and many more.
